# quantathon2025

This repository contains my team's solutions to the 2025 Carnegie Mellon University Quantathon.

**My contributions:**
- Derived the optimal strategy and analytical function for Problem 2.
- Developed the complete solution for Problem 3, including writing the Monte Carlo backward‑induction simulation.

The 2025 Quantathon problem set focused on a sequential “pass‑or‑play” game: in each round, a new uniform random draw is revealed, and the player must decide whether to pass or play, paying a small fee, to maximize the overall expected payoff.

We accomplished this using knowledge of expectations and probabilities, mathematical induction, optimal stopping theory, algorithm design, Monte Carlo simulation, and asymptotic analysis.
